# custom-uBlock-filter
I am now updating this using VS Code since Nov 22, 2022.
I have created this list so that I do not have to import "My Filter" rules everytime.

If you want to use this list, import it in uBlock Origin. Import link is provided below.

You can use uBlock Origin on Android. Download FireFox Android or Kiwi Browser (based on chromium).
I am thankful to the developers of Firefox, Kiwi and uBlock.
